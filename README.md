## 💡 Example Use Case

Here’s a quick example of how you might use dataforge in a project:

```cpp
#include "dataforge.hpp"

int main() {
    // Example of converting an integer to bytes
    int number = 12345;
    auto bytes = dataforge::intToBytes(number);
    
    // Example of encoding
    auto encoded = dataforge::base64Encode(bytes);
    
    // Output the encoded string
    std::cout << "Encoded output: " << encoded << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This simple code snippet shows how you could convert an integer to bytes and then encode it using Base64.

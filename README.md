# DataForge

**DataForge** is a modern C++20 header-only library for building declarative, composable data transformation pipelines.  
It provides both push (output) and pull (input) iterator-based interfaces for applying arbitrary chains of conversions, including encoding, decoding, compression, encryption, hashing, and Unicode operations.  
Transformations are described using *quarks* — small, composable objects that can be chained together with the `|` operator.

## Why DataForge is Unique

DataForge combines multiple types of data transformations in one consistent framework, unlike other libraries that cover only subsets of functionality.

| Feature / Capability         | DataForge | Crypto++ | Boost | ICU | range-v3 |
|-------------------------------|:---------:|:--------:|:----:|:---:|:--------:|
| Integer ↔ Bytes + Endian     | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| base16/32/58/64/ascii85/z85  | ✅        | ✅       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| Custom Base 1 < N < 256      | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| Checksums (crc, adler, bsd) | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| Hashes (MD, SHA, Blake, etc)| ✅        | ✅       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| Encryption/Decryption        | ✅        | ✅       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| Compression / Decompression  | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ❌  | ❌       |
| Unicode Conversions (UTF)    | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ✅  | ❌       |
| ICU Charset Conversions      | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ✅  | ❌       |
| Grapheme Breaking            | ✅        | ❌       | ❌   | ✅  | ❌       |
| Header-only                  | ✅        | ❌       | ✅   | ❌  | ✅       |
| Push/Pull iterator pipelines | ✅        | ❌       | ✅ (filters) | ❌ | ✅       |

**Key point:** DataForge allows chaining transformations like integer → endian → compression → encryption → base encoding in one declarative pipeline.

## Key Features

### 1. Integer ↔ Byte sequence conversions (with endianness)
- Convert sequences of integers of various sizes to/from byte sequences.
- Configurable **little-endian** or **big-endian** representation.

### 2. Encoding / Decoding
- **Base16, Base32, Base58, Base64, ASCII85, Z85**.
- Arbitrary base conversion with `1 < N < 256` and a custom alphabet — effectively a positional numeral system transformation.

### 3. Checksums
- BSD checksum
- Adler32
- CRC8, CRC16, CRC32, CRC64

### 4. Hash Functions
- MD2, MD4, MD5, MD6
- RIPEMD, Tiger
- SHA1, SHA2, SHA3
- Belt, GOST, Streebog, Whirlpool, Blake

### 5. Encryption / Decryption
- RC2, RC4, RC5, RC6
- DES, AES, Blowfish
- Belt, Magma

### 6. Compression / Decompression
- Deflate
- Bzip2
- LZ4
- LZMA, LZMA2  
*(requires corresponding external libraries)*

### 7. Unicode Encoding Conversions
- UTF-7, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32

### 8. ICU-based String Encoding Conversions
- Any encoding supported by the [ICU library](https://icu.unicode.org/)  
*(requires ICU library)*

### 9. Grapheme Breaker
- Splits a Unicode string into graphemes according to the [Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/).


## Installation for Running Tests

The library itself is **header-only** — nothing needs to be built for use in your projects.  
However, the test suite depends on external libraries (**zlib, icu, bzip2, lz4, liblzma, gtest**), which are managed via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

### Steps to build and run tests:
1. **Install vcpkg** anywhere on your system (if not already installed).
2. **Set the environment variable** `VCPKG_ROOT` to the location of your vcpkg installation.  
   - Example (Windows PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     setx VCPKG_ROOT "C:\dev\vcpkg"
     ```
3. Open the Visual Studio solution for tests and build it.  
   - On the first build:
     - The project will automatically:
       1. Check that `VCPKG_ROOT` is set.
       2. Run:
          ```powershell
          $(VCPKG_ROOT)\vcpkg.exe install
          ```
          installing all required dependencies from `vcpkg.json` into a local `vcpkg_installed` folder.
       3. Configure `INCLUDE` and `LIB` paths to use these locally installed dependencies.
4. Run the tests from Visual Studio.

**No global vcpkg integration (`vcpkg integrate install`) is required** — everything is local to the repository.
